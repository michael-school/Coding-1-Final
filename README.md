# Coding 1 Final

This website consists of three pages: the home page, about page, and contact page.
## Home
The Home page features a carousel that cycles through three pictures of different regions of Brazil. I am visiting my family in Brazil this summer, and these are some of the areas that I am hoping to see.
## About
The About page describes the various organizations and clubs I participate in and explains other ways I like to spend my time. It also briefly mentions my future plans.
## Contact
I designed the Contact Page to look like a business card. The card provides a nonexistant phone number (for security reasons), my school email, a link to the homepage of the website, and links to instagram and linkedin (these do not link to my personal accounts, again for security reasons). These are the things I imagine I would include on my business card.
